Viewer for geometry processing / meshes / 3d related stuff heavily inspired by [polyscope](https://polyscope.run) (which is very nice, check it out!).
Can be used in webpages thanks to wasm (such as reveal.js slides). Current repo can be used with [trunk](https://github.com/thedodd/trunk), just run `trunk serve`.

A few things that should be added :
* state saving/loading
* documentation
* optimization (better quantization, leading vertices for flat shading, why loading takes time?)
